# Approximate Pi Using Monte Carlo Algorithm
The PiMC programs use one command line argument that corresponds to the number of “iterations” used to compute pi with the Monte Carlo algorithm. The C program implements a serial code via a function call, and the CUDA program implements a parallel code via a kernel call. The hierarchical atomics strategy is used.
